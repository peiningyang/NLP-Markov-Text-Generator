# NLP: Markov Text Generator

This project is a bare-bone Markov Text Generator using Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility. The function takes the initial part of a sentence that we are trying to build on, a number which is the length of n-gram prediction, a corpus, and a flag of whether the process should be deterministic. It returns a sentence of maximum 15 words or when a period, exclamation point or question mark is deemed the next word.
